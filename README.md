I carried out my first encryption program that implements the Caeser cipher encryption and decryption algorithm.

The Caeser cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number ( e.g 5 ) of places down the alphabet.

-To use the program first creates a list of letters from the alphabet.
-It then prompts the user to input whether they want to encrypt or decrypt a message. 
-The user is also asked to input a key which is an integer between 0 and 9. 
-The program then applies the key to the input text and outputs the resulting encrypted or decrypted message.
 
Caesar cipher is one of the oldest encryption technique which is barely in use now a days. It can be used for basic encryption needs, but it is not recommended for highly sensitive information.
